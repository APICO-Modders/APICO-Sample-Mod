# APICO-Sample-Mod
This is an example mod to get your started!

This mod will define a bunch of different things, an item, a fake "book" menu, and an NPC

In the `/modules` folder you will see a module we are loading in with our `register()` hook
In the `/sprites` folder you will see an example of various sprites used in `api_define_*()` calls

Both the `mod-icon.png` and `mod-banner.png` are used in our approved mod check to provide an icon and banner in-game - you should provide these if trying to get a mod approved.
